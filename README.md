# Taller-de-RIPE_ATLAS

Course title: ***RIPE Atlas: Can we find where the Cloud is?***

This course focuses on explaining what RIPE Atlas is and how we can use it to create measurements of latency on Internet.

The course is supported by three types of files: 
1. **PDF guides** that consist in one guide for the course instructor and another guide for the student following this course 
2. **Jupyter Notebooks** that contain the code that run the code that we want to generate, either to create measurements 
3. ***Data files***, which are CSV files containing the required data to run the code in the notebooks.

## Procedure


Please, start by reading the PDF guide file that corresponds to your role:


+ `GUIDE_instructor.pdf`
+ `GUIDE_student.pdf`


The guide will explain you the context of the course, the motivation, and how to navigate the code. 
While reading the guide, you will be invited to open the Jupyter Notebook to follow the instructions that they contain to proceed with the course. 


There are two Jupyter Notebooks:


+ `latency1_whereIsTheCloud_A_createMeasurement.ipynb`
+ `latency1_whereIsTheCloud_A_getMeasurement.ipynb`


In order to create the measurements, you can define your own source and destination IP adresses, but we have already provided  example lists that are available at:


- `list_id_probes.csv`
- `list_url_ip_destination.csv`

## About


This course has been created by the Opportunistic Architectures Lab of [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://networks.imdea.org "Developing the Science of Networks"), in the frame of the TelecoRenta Proyect from the UNICO 5G Program.
